1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
React JS is a component based library build for always-on sites such as those that allow users to make new posts or ones that will need updated frequently, often hundreds or thousands of times per day. It's easier to use a component each time than it is to hard code every time an update is made.

1. What does it mean to think in react?
Thinking in React means breaking everything down into the smallest components and then thinking about how you will piece them together.
1. Describe state.
State is a way to show a user different things based on how they have interacted with the website or based on other criteria such as what day or time it is. It allows us to have multiple versions of certain components and only show one at a time.

1. Describe props.
Props are properties that can be passed from one component to another using the props argument.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
Side effects are anything that happens outside of the scope of a React component. You can sync effects in a component to state or prop changes by watching for a change or using the useEffect hook.
